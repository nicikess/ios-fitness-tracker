# iOS Programming

## Description
This reposity include the final project of the IOS course that I took in my Bachelors at HSLU.The course provides an introduction to the fundamental building blocks of iOS programming architecture, the practical application of the iOS Software Development Kit (SDK), and an overview and hands-on experience with the Swift programming language.

## Key Topics Covered
1. iOS Program Architecture: Gain a deep understanding of the underlying architecture of iOS apps, including the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern, navigation controllers, and view controllers.

2. iOS SDK Application: Learn how to effectively use the iOS Software Development Kit (SDK) to leverage the wide range of features and functionalities available on the iOS platform.

3. Swift Programming Language: Dive into the Swift programming language, the primary language used for iOS app development. Understand its syntax, key concepts, and best practices for writing efficient and maintainable code.

4. App Development: Put your knowledge into practice by building your own iOS apps. The course places a strong emphasis on hands-on development, providing numerous practical exercises and culminating in an individual capstone project.

## Final project
This repository includes the source code of the final project. As this I developed an IOS app that can be used to track runs and biking routes when training as store the data locally on the device.

## Getting Started
To get started with iOS Programming, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have a Mac computer with Xcode, the official integrated development environment (IDE) for iOS app development, installed.
3. Open the project in Xcode.
4. Navigate through the course materials, organized by topics, and explore the code examples provided.
5. Complete the practical exercises to reinforce your understanding of the concepts.
6. Work on your individual capstone project, applying your skills to create a fully functional iOS app.
